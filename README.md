## About me

I’m a **product-focused full-stack developer** who likes building things end-to-end — from idea to shipped product.

Alongside development, I run a small content & growth agency where I work closely with early-stage startups.  
This gives me strong exposure to **real users, distribution, and fast iteration**, which directly influences how I build software.
